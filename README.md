Time and Space Complexity for Plus Minus:
  The code for this problem takes O(N) time to run, since it is a single for loop that completes a constant amount of work within itself, and the loop operates over the length, N, of the array. The space complexity is O(1) since the only new variables initialized for this problem are doubles that keep track of the count of each value, and the input size is a single array that is not altered in any way.
